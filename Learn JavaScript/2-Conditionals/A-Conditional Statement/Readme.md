# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
## What are Conditional Statements?
In life, we make decisions based on circumstances. Think of an everyday decision as mundane as falling asleep — if we are tired, we go to bed, otherwise, we wake up and start our day.

These if-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating conditional statements. A conditional statement checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

In this lesson, we will explore how programs make decisions by evaluating conditions and introduce logic into our code!

We’ll be covering the following concepts:

if, else if, and else statements
comparison operators
logical operators
truthy vs falsy values
ternary operators
switch statement
So if you’re ready to learn these concepts go to the next lesson— else, read over the concepts, observe the diagram, and prepare yourself for this lesson!


## Review
Way to go! Here are some of the major concepts for conditionals:

An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
We can add more conditions using else if statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.
The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
