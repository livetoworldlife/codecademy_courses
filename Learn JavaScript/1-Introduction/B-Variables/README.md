# Variables
In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory.

Variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.

In short, variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

Create a variable with a descriptive name.
Store or update information stored in a variable.
Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.
It is important to distinguish that variables are not values; they contain values and represent them with a name. Observe the diagram with the colored boxes. Each box represents variables; the values are represented by the content, and the name is represented with the label.

In this lesson, we will cover how to use the var, let, and const keywords to create variables.

## Review Variables
Nice work! This lesson introduced you to variables, a powerful concept you will use in all your future programming endeavors.

Let’s review what we learned:

Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
Variables are stored in memory.
The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables
In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.
