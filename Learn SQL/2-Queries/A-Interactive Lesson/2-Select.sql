/*
Select
Previously, we learned that SELECT is used every time you want to query data from a database and * means all columns.

Suppose we are only interested in two of the columns. We can select individual columns by their names (separated by a comma):

SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name;
To make it easier to read, we moved FROM to another line.

Line breaks donâ€™t mean anything specific in SQL. We could write this entire query in one line, and it would run just fine.
