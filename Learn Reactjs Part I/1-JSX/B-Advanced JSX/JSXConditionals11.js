/**
 JSX Conditionals: The Ternary Operator
There’s a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the ternary operator.

The ternary operator works the same way in React as it does in regular JavaScript. However, it shows up in React surprisingly often.

Recall how it works: you write x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either “truthy” or “falsy.” If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z. Here’s a nice explanation if you need a refresher.

Here’s how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:

const headline = (
  <h1>
    { age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' }
  </h1>
);
In the above example, if age is greater than or equal to drinkingAge, then headline will equal <h1>Buy Drink</h1>. Otherwise, headline will equal <h1>Do Teen Stuff</h1>.
