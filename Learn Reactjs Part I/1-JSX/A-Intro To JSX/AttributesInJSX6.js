/**
 Attributes In JSX
JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"
Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

<a href="http://www.example.com">Welcome to the Web</a>;

const title = <h1 id="title">Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>;
A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

const panda = <img src="images/panda.jpg" alt="panda" width="500px" height="500px" />;

 */

const p1 = <p id="large">foo</p>;
const p2 = <p id="small">bar</p>;
