/**
Render a Component's props
You just passed information to a component’s props object!

You will often want a component to display the information that you pass.

Here’s how to make a component display passed-in information:

1 - Find the component class that is going to receive that information.
2 - Include this.props.name-of-information in that component class’s render method’s return statement.
