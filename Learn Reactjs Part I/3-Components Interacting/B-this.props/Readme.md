# this.props
Previously, you learned one way that components can interact: a component can render another component.

In this lesson, you will learn another way that components can interact: a component can pass information to another component.

Information that gets passed from one component to another is known as “props.”

## this.props Recap
That completes our lesson on props!

props is quite possibly the longest and most difficult lesson in all of our React courses. Congratulations on getting this far!

Here are some of the skills that you have learned:

Passing a prop by giving an attribute to a component instance
Accessing a passed-in prop via this.props.prop-name
Displaying a prop
Using a prop to make decisions about what to display
Defining an event handler in a component class
Passing an event handler as a prop
Receiving a prop event handler and attaching it to an event listener
Naming event handlers and event handler attributes according to convention
this.props.children
getDefaultProps
That’s a lot! Don’t worry if it’s all a bit of a blur. Soon you’ll get plenty of practice!
