# Components Interact
A React application can contain dozens, or even hundreds, of components.

Each component might be small and relatively unremarkable on its own. When combined, however, they can form enormous, fantastically complex ecosystems of information.

In other words, React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isnâ€™t components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.

This unit is an introduction to components interacting.
