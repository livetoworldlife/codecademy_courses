/**
Require A File
When you use React.js, every JavaScript file in your application is invisible to every other JavaScript file by default. ProfilePage.js and NavBar.js can’t see each other.

This is a problem!

On line 9, you just added an instance of the NavBar component class. But since you’re in ProfilePage.js, JavaScript has no idea what NavBar means.

If you want to use a variable that’s declared in a different file, such as NavBar, then you have to import the variable that you want. To import a variable, you can use an import statement:

import { NavBar } from './NavBar.js';
We’ve used import before, but not like this! Notice the differences between the above line of code and this familiar line:

import React from 'react';
The first important difference is the curly braces around NavBar. We’ll get to those soon!

The second important difference involves the contents of the string at the end of the statement: 'react' vs './NavBar.js'.

If you use an import statement, and the string at the end begins with either a dot or a slash, then import will treat that string as a filepath. import will follow that filepath, and import the file that it finds.

If your filepath doesn’t have a file extension, then “.js” is assumed. So the above example could be shortened:

import { NavBar } from './NavBar';
One final, important note:
None of this behavior is specific to React! Module systems of independent, importable files are a very popular way to organize code. React’s specific module system comes from ES6. More on all of that later. */

// ProfilePage.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { NavBar } from './NavBar';

class ProfilePage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <NavBar />
        <h1>All About Me!</h1>
        <p>I like movies and blah blah blah blah blah</p>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/React/react_photo-monkeyselfie.jpg" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<ProfilePage />, document.getElementById('app'));


//NavBar.js
import React from 'react';

export class NavBar extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const pages = ['home', 'blog', 'pics', 'bio', 'art', 'shop', 'about', 'contact'];
    const navLinks = pages.map(page => {
      return (
        <a href={'/' + page}>
          {page}
        </a>
      )
    });

    return <nav>{navLinks}</nav>;
  }
}
