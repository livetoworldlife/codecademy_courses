# State
Dynamic information is information that can change.

React components will often need dynamic information in order to render. For example, imagine a component that displays the score of a basketball game. The score of the game might change over time, meaning that the score is dynamic. Our component will have to know the score, a piece of dynamic information, in order to render in a useful way.

There are two ways for a component to get dynamic information: props and state. Besides props and state, every value used in a component should always stay exactly the same.

You just spent a long lesson learning about props. Now it’s time to learn about state. props and state are all that you need to set up an ecosystem of interacting React components.

## Components Interacting Recap
In this unit, you learned how to use import and export to access one file from another. You learned about props and state, and the countless variations on how they work.

Before this unit, you learned about JSX, components, and how they can work together.

A React app is basically just a lot of components, setting state and passing props to one another. Now that you have a real understanding of how to use props and state, you have by far the most important tools that you need!

In future lessons, the focus will shift slightly outward. In addition to learning more new skills, you’ll also learn your first programming patterns. These large-scale strategies will help you combine what you’ve learned and really start building.
