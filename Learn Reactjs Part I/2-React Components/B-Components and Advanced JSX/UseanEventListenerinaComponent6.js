/**
Use an Event Listener in a Component
Render functions often contain event listeners. Hereâ€™s an example of an event listener in a render function:

render() {
  return (
    <div onHover={myFunc}>
    </div>
  );
}
Recall that an event handler is a function that gets called in response to an event. In the above example, the event handler is myFunc().

In React, you define event handlers as methods on a component class. Like this:

class MyClass extends React.Component {
  myFunc() {
    alert('Stop it.  Stop hovering.');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div onHover={this.myFunc}>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
Notice that the component class has two methods: .myFunc() and .render(). .myFunc() is being used as an event handler. .myFunc() will be called any time that a user hovers over the rendered <div></div>.
