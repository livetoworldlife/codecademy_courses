# Components and Advanced JSX
LESSON
Apply your knowledge of JSX to React components.

## Components Recap
Congratulations! You have finished the unit on React components.

React components are complicated. Their syntax is complicated, and the reasoning behind their syntax is especially complicated.

You have learned a lot about both their syntax and their reasoning. You have learned about component classes and component instances. You have learned about React.Component, and about the instructions that you must provide to a component class. You have learned how to import, and how to render a component instance.

You have been introduced to some common ways of using JSX in React components. You have rendered components using multiline JSX expressions, logic inside of the render function, a conditional statement, this, and an event listener.

You have spent a lot of time studying React components in isolation! Now, itâ€™s time to start learning how components fit into with the world around them.
