/**
Hello World, Part II... THE COMPONENT
React applications are made out of components.

What’s a component?

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML.

Take a look at the code below. This code will create and render a new React component:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
A lot of that code is probably unfamiliar. However you can recognize some JSX in there, as well as ReactDOM.render().

We are going to unpack that code, one small piece at a time. By the end of this lesson, you’ll understand how to build a React component!

  document.getElementById('app')
);
