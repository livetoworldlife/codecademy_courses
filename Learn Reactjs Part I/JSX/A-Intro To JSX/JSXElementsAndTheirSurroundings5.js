/**
 JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array…you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};
