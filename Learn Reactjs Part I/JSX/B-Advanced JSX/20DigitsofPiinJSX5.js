/**
 20 Digits of Pi in JSX
You can now inject regular JavaScript into JSX expressions! This will be extremely useful.

In the code editor, you can see a JSX expression that displays the first twenty digits of pi.

Study the expression and notice the following:

The code is written in a JavaScript file. By default, it will all be treated as regular JavaScript.
Find <div> on line 5. From there up through </div>, the code will be treated as JSX.
Find Math. From there up through (20), the code will be treated as regular JavaScript again.
The curly braces themselves wonâ€™t be treated as JSX nor as JavaScript. They are markers that signal the beginning and end of a JavaScript injection into JSX, similar to the quotation marks that signal the boundaries of a string.
